    <string name="about_text"><b>About Digit Dots</b> \nDigit Dots are a way to teach basic addition and subtraction skills.
        Students learn the position of dots and lines (forming an \'X\') on each digit. The number of marks on each digit
        corresponds to the value of the digit. To add two digits together, students just count the marks on each digit to find the sum.
        In \'Learn\' mode, students learn the placement of the dots and lines on the digits. In \'Practice\' mode, students have to remember
        where the dots and lines are located. In \'Addition Quiz\' mode, student get to apply what they have learned to answer ten addition
        problems.\n\n<b>Why are Digit Dots better than alternatives?</b> \nDigit Dots have some improvements over another similar system. One
    improvement is the use of an \'X\' to indicate a spot to count twice instead of a circle with a line around it. The \'X\' is much easier for
        young students to write, especially stucdents with low fine-motor skills. Another improvement
        is the position of the dots on the digit \'four\'. Compared to another popular system, the position of the Digit Dots on a
        \'four\' make it easier for students to place on different types of \'fours\'.\n\n<b>Worksheets and Posters</b>
